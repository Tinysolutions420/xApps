## **5. Real-Time Example Application**  

### **Use Case: Handover Optimization in a Dense Urban 5G Network**  

**Scenario:**  
- A 5G network in a dense urban area experiences frequent handovers as users move between small cells.  
- A **Handover Optimization xApp** runs on the near-RT RIC to improve mobility performance.  

**How the Routing Manager Helps:**  
1. **Collects real-time UE mobility data** from the RAN via the E2 interface.  
2. **Distributes the data** to multiple xApps, including Handover Optimization and Traffic Steering xApps.  
3. **Ensures timely handover decisions** by routing decision-making messages to the appropriate RAN nodes.  
4. **Monitors and logs handover efficiency** for AI-based performance tuning.  

By leveraging the Routing Manager, the system **reduces handover failures, minimizes latency, and improves user experience.**

## **6. How to Integrate the Routing Manager with the Environment**  

To integrate the Routing Manager within an O-RAN SC RIC environment, follow these steps:

### **Step 1: Install the RIC Platform**
- Deploy the **RIC platform** using Kubernetes-based orchestration.
- Ensure that the **RIC Message Router (RMR)** and Routing Manager are included.

### **Step 2: Configure Routing Manager**
- Modify the Routing Manager configuration file (`rm-config.yaml`) to define routing policies.
- Set up **message routing rules** for xApps.

### **Step 3: Deploy xApps**
- Develop xApps that register with the Routing Manager via API calls.
- Use the **RIC SDK** (Software Development Kit) to ensure xApps can send and receive messages using RMR.

### **Step 4: Integrate with E2 Nodes**
- Connect the **E2 Termination Service** to establish communication between the RIC and RAN.
- Use **E2AP (E2 Application Protocol)** messages to send control instructions.

### **Step 5: Monitor and Optimize**
- Enable logging and monitoring to observe message flow.
- Use **Grafana/Prometheus** for real-time analytics and visualization.
- Fine-tune routing policies for better performance.
